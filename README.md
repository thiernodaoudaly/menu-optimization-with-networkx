**Applying graph coloring to find the minimum number of dishes required to satisfy all dietary requirements simultaneously — with no incompatible pairings.**

</div>

## Problem Statement

Hotels and high-traffic venues must accommodate a wide variety of dietary requirements: gluten-free, vegan, lactose-free, nut-free, egg-free, fish-free, red-meat-free, and more.

The central question: **what is the minimum number of distinct dishes needed to cover all dietary regimes, given that some combinations are incompatible?**

This is a direct application of the **graph coloring problem** — a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem — where:
- Each **node** represents a dietary regime
- Each **edge** connects two regimes that **cannot be served by the same dish** (incompatibility)
- The **minimum number of colours** needed to colour the graph = the **minimum number of dishes** required

## Approach

### Modelling

8 dietary regimes are modelled as nodes in an undirected graph:

```
Sans gluten · Végétalien · Sans lactose · Sans fruits à coque
Sans produits laitiers · Sans œufs · Sans poisson · Sans viande rouge
```

Edges are added between regimes that are **mutually compatible** (can be served by the same dish). Incompatible pairs have no edge — meaning they require separate dishes.

### Algorithm

`nx.greedy_color()` from NetworkX applies a **greedy graph coloring algorithm** that assigns colours to nodes such that no two adjacent nodes share the same colour, while minimising the total number of colours used.

```python
# Core of the solution
colors = nx.greedy_color(G)
num_dishes = max(colors.values()) + 1
print(f"Minimum number of dishes required: {num_dishes}")
```

Each colour = one dish category that satisfies a group of compatible regimes.

### Visualisation

The graph is rendered with Matplotlib at two stages:
1. **Before coloring** — plain graph showing regime nodes and compatibility edges
2. **After coloring** — colour-coded graph where each colour group identifies regimes that a single dish can cover
